						<h2>About Me</h2>
						<p>My name is Aaron and have always had a fascination with sharp knives. On night, in late 2020, I was in bed reading a book on edge geometry and realized it was time to start helping others find the thrill of a sharp knife.</p>

							<h3>Our Process for Sharpening</h3>
							<p>I do all of my sharpening on a Tormek T8. I chose this system for a few reasons. In a skilled hand it provides an unparalleled edge on a wide range of blades. I am also a fan of the stone constantly runnign through a trough of water to prevent the blade from overheating which can cause damage to the temper of your edge. This issue which can happen on bench grinders or belt sanders has the effect of making your edge more brittle and increases its likeliness to chip. In my process I start with a 220 grit to clean and set the angle and grade up to 1000 before honing the blade to remove the burr (an almost microscopic roll of the edge that is created during the sharpening process) after I have sharpened the blade, I handwash it and prepare it to return to its owner. </p>

							<h3>Standard Service</h3>
							<h4>$1.50/ inch, $5 minimum</h4>
							<p>My Standard Service comes with a sharpening on the 220 grit stone, grading up to 1000, finishing with a hone and a handwash. After I am done washing and drying, I will place your knife in a cardboard sheath (if it did not come with its own sheath) cut to length. Most knives will be eligible for this service, with the exception of speciality knives an example being a single bevel japanese knife.</p>

This is the service reccomended for your standard high end knives. This is also the service for if your would like a different angle bevel on your blade.
